# Problems-in-AI
A few problems solved using AI-based algorithms and techniques:
1. TSP - The travelling salesman problem solved using A* search with a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) heuristic.
2. Sudoku - Solves Sudoku puzzles treating them as a Constraint satisfaction problem. Uses recursive backtracking and the AC3 and Naked Pairs inference techniques to minimize the number of guesses needed to be made to arrive at a solution. Also determines the difficulty of a Sudoku puzzle.
